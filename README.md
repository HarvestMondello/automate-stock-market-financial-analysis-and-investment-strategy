## About the Project
For this analysis I combined, cleaned up and conducted a preliminary exploratory analysis in Python and then conducted a financial analyzed, used a weighted ranked system and visualized in Tableau. 

The Data for this project came from three sources:
1. Historical data going back to 1962 came from Ralhil Parikh on kaggle:

<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/0f304bbe024f01fc9cbc0117d9a6dc6767935789b73b0794f541f7e60af0cf62"> Kaggle dataset</a>

2. Historical data going back 10 years: came from the Yahoo Finance API.
3. Fundamental data: came from Google Finance.
